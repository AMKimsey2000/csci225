            <h1>Introduction</h1>
            <p>Hi, my name is Adam Kimsey, and I'm currently a sophomore here at USC Aiken. I am majoring in computer science with no concentration with a minor in mathematics<br>
                as science and math are my two favorite subjects. I enjoy programming for fun on occasion and playing games on my computer quite frequently, but outside of that, <br>
                there isn't much else that I enjoy doing. I am hoping to get a good paying job after finishing my degree here and hope to move somewhere that I enjoy as I don't<br>
                plan on moving around a lot at that point.</p>
            <h3>I also really like space!</h3>
